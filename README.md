# Classical Logic Gates and Half Adder – QML Series

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of classical logic gates (AND, OR, XOR) and a **half adder** using Python.

📘 **Notebook Highlights**
- ✅ Truth tables and logical behavior
- 🔧 Implementation of AND, OR, XOR gates
- ➕ Half Adder circuit logic and output verification
- 🧠 Serves as a bridge to quantum logic circuit design
